## Usage

To start, go to the [Humble Bundle website][hb-site] and log in. Then find the cookie value for `_simpleauth_sess`. This is required to interact with Humble Bundle API. 

See this guide on how to find the cookie value for your browser: [Chrome][guide-chrome], [Firefox][guide-firefox], [Safari][guide-safari].

Use `humble-cli auth "<YOUR SESSION KEY>"` to store the authentication key locally for other subcommands.

After that you will have access to the following sub-commands:

```
$ humble-cli --help
